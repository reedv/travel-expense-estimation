"""mysite URL Configuration

The `urlpatterns` list routes URLs to views. For more information please see:
    https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.11/topics/http/urls/
Examples:
Function views
    1. Add an import:  from my_app import views
    2. Add a URL to urlpatterns:  url(r'^$', views.home, name='home')
Class-based views
    1. Add an import:  from other_app.views import Home
    2. Add a URL to urlpatterns:  url(r'^$', Home.as_view(), name='home')
Including another URLconf
    1. Import the include() function: from django.conf.urls import url, include
    2. Add a URL to urlpatterns:  url(r'^blog/', include('blog.urls'))

	The include() function allows referencing other URLconfs. 
	Note that the regular expressions for the include() function doesnâ€™t have a $ 
	(end-of-string match character) but rather a trailing slash. Whenever Django 
	encounters include(), it chops off whatever part of the URL matched up to that 
	point and sends the remaining string to the included URLconf for further processing.

    url(r'^admin/', admin.site.urls),
